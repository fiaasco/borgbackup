This role installs Borg backup on borgbackup\_servers and clients. The role contains a wrapper-script 'borg-backup' to ease the usage on the client. Supported options include borg-backup info | init | list | backup | mount. Automysqlbackup will run as pre-backup command if it's installed.
The role supports both self hosted and offsite backup-storage such as rsync.net and hetzner storage box as Borg server.

It's possible to configure append-only repositories to secure the backups against deletion from the client.

Ansible 2.9 or higher is required to run this role.

## Required variables
Define a group borgbackup\_servers in your inventory with one or multiple hosts. The group borgbackup\_management is only necessary if you want to enable append-only mode and prune the backups from a secured hosts.
```
[borgbackup_servers]
backup1.fiaas.co

[borgbackup_management]
supersecurehost
```

Define group- or hostvars for your backup endpoints and retention:
```
borgbackup_servers:
  - id: fiaas
    fqdn: backup1.fiaas.co
    user: borgbackup
    type: normal
    home: /backup/
    pool: repos
    options: ""
  - id: rsync
    fqdn: yourhost.rsync.net
    user: userid
    type: rsync.net
    home: ""
    pool: repos
    options: "--remote-path=borg1"
  - id: hetzner
    fqdn: username.your-storagebox.de
    user: username
    type: hetzner
    home: ""
    pool: repos
    options: ""


borgbackup_retention:
  hourly: 12
  daily: 7
  weekly: 4
  monthly: 6
  yearly: 1
```
*WARNING: the trailing / in item.home is required.*

Define a borg\_passphrase for every host.
host\_vars\client1:
```
borgbackup_passphrase: Ahl9EiNohr5koosh1Wohs3Shoo3ooZ6p
```

Per default the role creates a cronjob in /etc/cron.d/borg-backup running as root every day on a random hour between 0 and 5am on a random minute. Override the defaults if necessary:
```
borgbackup_client_user: root
borgbackup_cron_day: "*"
borgbackup_cron_minute: "{{ 59|random }}"
borgbackup_cron_hour: "{{ 5|random }}"
```
Override borgbackup\_client\_user where required, for example if you have a laptop with an encrypted homedir you'll have to run the backup as the user of that homedir.

Set borgbackup\_appendonly: True in host or group vars if you want append-only repositories. In that case it's possible to define a hostname in borgbackup\_management\_station where a borg prune script will be configured. Only the management station will have permission to prune old backups for (all) clients. This will generate serve with --append-only ssh key options.
If you set borgbackup\_appendonly\_repoconfig to True, this will also disable the possibility to remove backups from the management station. (Or at least: it's not possible to remove them till you reconfigure the repository and this is currently not supported in the prune script)
Be aware of the limitations of append-only mode: [pruned backups appear to be removed, but are only removed in the transaction log till something writes in normal mode to the repository](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/3504))

*Make sure to check the configured defaults for this role, which contains the list of default locations being backed up in backup\_include.* Override this in your inventory where required.

## Installing Borg from Package
Borg can be installed from a package by setting the variable:
```
borgbackup_install_from_pkg: true
```

On EPEL systems (RedHat/CentOS) the epel-release repository will be added automatically using [`geerlingguy.repo-epel`](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/repo-epel) role.

## Usage

Configure Borg on the server and on a client:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory/test backup.yml -l backup1.fiaas.co
ansible-playbook -i inventory/test backup.yml -l client1.fiaas.co
```

## Testing

All role-functionality is tested using molecule using a local docker connection to avoid complexity.
For more information on molecule testing, see [`https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
Tests are written using Testinfra, see [`https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/`](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Because of the variety of scenarios, tests themselves are stored in [`molecule/generic_files`](molecule/generic_files) to optimise re-usability. They can be applied to hosts/groups using groups.

Getting started with testing is as easy as doing the following on any machine with a local docker engine running:
*(from within the root directory of this role)*

```bash
$ virtualenv -p python3 ~/.venv/fiaasco-borgbackup-docu
$ source ~/.venv/fiaasco-borgbackup-docu/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ molecule test
```

Make sure to test all functionality. Failing builds will not be accepted in PR review!
Every test-scenario runs at least a full deployment with a backup server, performs a backup, executes a restore-test and various other minor tests, ensuring functional stability.

### Test Scenarios

#### default
```
molecule test
```

This scenario tests the most common functionality on Debian platforms. It runs a backup server on the 2 latest official Debian releases.

#### centos
```
molecule test -s centos
```

This scenario tests the most common functionality on EPEL platforms. It runs a backup server on the 2 latest official CentOS releases.

#### ubuntu
```
molecule test -s ubuntu
```

This scenario tests the most common functionality on Ubuntu platforms. It runs a backup server on the 2 latest official Ubuntu releases.

#### multiple
```
molecule test -s multiple
```

This scenario ensures role functionality works when 2 or more backup-servers are defined.

#### lamp
```
molecule test -s lamp
```

Testing functionality when `fiaas.lamp` role is applied to a machine, ensuring compatibility with a 'Fiaas'-host. See [`molecule.yml`](molecule/lamp/molecule.yml) for details.

#### clients
```
molecule test -s clients
```

This test is the biggest scenario as it contains testing for all supported platforms and combinations. Eg. Debian 8 + 9 + 10, Fedora 31, ... As we all run different systems and platforms, this can be extended safely provided this scenario keeps running!
